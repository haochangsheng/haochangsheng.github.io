Here is Changsheng Hao, a gap year student who has completed a bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research focuses on designing and developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. This personal page is aimed at showcasing the projects and research I have conducted, as well as sharing my ordinary but happy life.


### Education:
- **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** (2019 - 2023)   
  Bachelor of Engineering in Automation
- **Chengdu No.7 High School** (2016 - 2019)   


### Softwares:
- [**PKB2**](https://github.com/zengliX/PKB2), 2018:      
	A general kernel-boosting framework. Use clinical features and gene expression from typical cancer genomic study datasets to predict outcomes of interest. Support classification, regression, and survival analysis.

- [**SIFA**](https://github.com/zengliX/SIFA) (tumor **S**ubclone **I**dentification by **F**eature **A**llocation), 2017:            
	a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify tumor subclones and infer phylogenetic tree from WGS data
 
- [**PKB**](https://github.com/zengliX/PKB) (**P**athway-based **K**ernel **B**oosting), 2017:      
	a boosting framework using gene expression and pathway information for classification
